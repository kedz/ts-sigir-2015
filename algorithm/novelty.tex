\subsection{Ensuring Novelty}
We run AP clustering with our rescaled and penalized sentence similarities
and preferences. When the clustering has converged we emit all exemplar
sentences (cluster centers) whose preference is $\lambda$ standard deviations
above the mean preference for the current time period and who do not belong
to singleton clusters as updates. These updates and their preferences are 
retained for penalty calculations in subsequent time steps.
