\begin{abstract}
During crises such as natural disasters or other human tragedies, information
needs of both civilians and responders often require urgent, specialized
treatment.  
Monitoring and summarizing a text stream
during such an event remains a difficult problem. 
We present a system for update summarization which predicts the salience of 
sentences with respect to an event and then uses these
predictions to directly bias a clustering algorithm for sentence selection,
increasing the quality of the updates. We use novel, disaster-specific features
for salience prediction, including geo-locations and language models
representing the language of disaster.
Our evaluation on a standard set of retrospective events using ROUGE shows 
that salience prediction provides a significant improvement over 
other approaches.
