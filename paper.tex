% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls' V2.5
% LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting articles to ACM
% Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS
% (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.  The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a
% similar-looking, albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer
% pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces: 1) The Permission

% Line with ACM data 4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which DOES NOT produce 1) thru'
% 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within the source
% .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM
% Copyright Data (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).  e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.

\maketitle \begin{abstract} 
During crises such as natural disasters or other human tragedies, information needs of both civilians and responders often require urgent, specialized treatment.  Slow or ineffective information access can significantly impact the safety and health of individuals.  Monitoring and summarizing a text stream during such an event remains a difficult problem.  The temporal summarization task refers to extracting short, sentence-length updates about a seed event from a stream of text data.  We present a system which makes substantial improvements over the state of the art in temporal summarization.  Our approach predicts the salience of sentences with respect to an event and then uses these predictions to directly bias a clustering algorithm for sentence selection, increasing the novelty of the updates. We use novel, disaster-specific features for salience prediction, including geo-locations and language models representing the language typically used to describe different disaster types. 
We evaluate our system on a standard set of retrospective events using a combination of human judgements and automatic evaluation measures. We demonstrate the effect of different feature groups, and the importance of salience prediction for update precision.

\section{Run Submissions}

We submitted three different runs for official evaluation. The first system,
(AP+) used AP clustering without salience predictions or redundancy penalty.
The clustering was run every hour, and all non-singleton exemplars were 
taken as the updates.

Our second submission (AP+Sal+) uses our salience prediction model, with the
AP clustering to select sentences. We do not penalize for redundancy.

Our final run (AP+Sal+Red-) is the same as the previous run but the 
redundancy penalty is applied.

\section{Results}

Overall it appears that (AP+Sal+) is our best performing model of the three
submissions. One of the notable differences is in the average number of 
updates per event. (AP+Sal+) was by far the most terse system, with 
383.2 updates/event compared to 5997.8 and 1070.7 for (AP+) and (AP+Sal+Red-)
respectively.
Despite not returning many updates, $\mathbb{E}$[Latency Gain] was high enough
on average to outperform on the F1 score compared to the other two systems.
The differences in F1 from the baseline run for both (AP+Sal+) and 
(AP+Sal+Red-) are statistically significant; 
this is empirical validation of our salience modeling efforts.

\hline
AP+Sal+ & 0.0751 &  0.4139 & $\mathbf{0.1162}$\\
\hline
AP+Sal+Red- & 0.0375 & 0.3413 & 0.0602\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Submission results, averaged over 2014 TREC TS events.}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, there is still much work to be done with our redundancy 
component. (AP+Sal+Red-) returned an order of magnitude more updates on 
average than (AP+Sal+) but still achieved comparatively lower comprehensiveness
scores. The redundancy penalty is perhaps too aggressive, driving the 
clustering to focus on very novel input spaces---so novel as to be 
irrelevant. 

A related issue with our current model is that our salience predictions
are relative from the point of view of the clustering algorithm. If all inputs
have low salience predictions, the AP clustering will still find exemplars, 
albeit from the most salient inputs. This becomes especially problematic 
with the redundancy component, as with every timestep, we are evaluating 
riskier and riskier sets of more novel sentences, and being forced to return
something. This behavior can be observed especially in the updates from the
Chelyabinsk meteor event, where our document retrieval stage was 
under-performing and the predicted salience of all updates was quite low.
This would suggest implementing some minimum threshold of salience. We
initially experimented with such a threshold but found tuning it across 
events of different magnitudes to be difficult.
