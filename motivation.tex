\section{Motivation}

Most multi-document summarization approaches involve either sentence 
clustering or ranking or both to select summary sentences.
When the summarization task
is broad or underspecified, clustering is most appropriate in that the data
"speaks for itself." This is probably most true when summarization is 
interpretted to mean exploratory data analysis. 
When there are more constraints on the output, as in many text summarization
tasks,
it is often easier to design appropriate features for the ranking approach, 
either by rule or learning-to-rank. The primary contribution of this paper
is a framework for combining both of these approaches using affinity
propagation clustering. Additionally, we provide a task specific evaluation
of this clustering model on the TREC Temporal Summarization task. 


\ckcomment{Not sure how to present this together, we also essentially evaluate
a salience model by feature ablation for the TS task, but this feels very specific compared to the general framework idea.}
